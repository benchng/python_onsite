>>>>>>> bc3f49e9df9e267dd9e0aef79381e81971cf2159

- create a new table named "users_cars" with the following fields:
    - id (auto increment)
    - userID (refers to "id" in users table)
    - carID (refers to "id" in cars table)


- create a new table named "users" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - first name
    - last name

- create a new table named "cars" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - make
    - model
    - color
    - year

- populate these tables with at least 5 records each - the more the merrier

- Write the SQL queries to accomplish the following: (write each of your queries below for review)

    - select all records from users
       SELECT * FROM cars

    - select all records from cars where car make = "Toyota"

    SELECT * FROM cars
    WHERE make = 'bmw';


    - use a join to select the first name and car model of every user who has bought a car

    SELECT users.first_name , cars.model
    FROM cars
    INNER JOIN users_cars
    ON cars.id = users_cars."carID"
    INNER JOIN users
    ON users_cars"usersID"=users.id


    - use a join to select the first and last name of everyone who has bought a red car

     SELECT users."first_name", cars."model"
     FROM cars
     INNER JOIN users_cars
     ON cars.id = users_cars."carID"
     INNER JOIN users
     ON users_cars."userID"=users.id
     WHERE cars.color = 'black';

    - use an insert statement to create a new record in each table
     INSERT INTO cars (make, model, color, year)
     VALUES ('honda', 's2000', 'yellow', 2008);

     INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name)
     VALUES ('oliver', 'tang');

    - use sql to update a record in the "cars" table

    UPDATE cars
    SET model = '350z', color = 'pink'
    WHERE id = 1 IS NULL;

    - delete one record from the database

      DELETE FROM cars as c
      WHERE c.model='350z';
